# MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition with PyTorch

This project demonstrates a convolutional neural network (CNN) implemented in PyTorch to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The model achieves an impressive test accuracy of **99.01%** after 5 epochs of training.

## **Features**
- Built a custom PyTorch `Dataset` class to preprocess data from a CSV file.
- Implemented a CNN architecture for image classification.
- Trained the model with **Adam optimizer** and **CrossEntropyLoss**.
- Achieved high accuracy with efficient training and validation splits.
